        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Geoffrey Smeddle's Lobster Thermidor recipe offers a twist on</p>
        <p>the Parisian classic, bringing it home to Britain with the use of</p>
        <p>Anster cheese - a handmade, traditional and local cheese made</p>
        <p>on the North West coast of Scotland carrying a delicate and</p>
        <p>rich flavour, similar to that of Wenslydale or a mild English</p>
        <p>Cheddar. This recipe was developed as part of Geoffrey's</p>
        <p>collaboration with the Sunday Herald.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To cook the lobster, bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add enough salt to
                taste like sea water and half the amount of sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                Drop the lobsters into the water for 3 minutes, remove and plunge directly into
                heavily iced water. Leave the lobsters to cool for 5 minutes before removing from
                the water
            </li>
            <li>
                Break down the lobster by removing the claws and dissecting the body. Remove the
                tail meat, entrails and sinew. Rinse the head and tail and use scissors to trim the
                tail and head to smooth edges, repeat for all lobsters
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you've prepared all the lobster and the shells, use the left body and claw meat
                to place in the right side shells and vice versa. This is for presentation purposes
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the back of a large chefs knife and kitchen scissors to crack and remove the
                meat from both the claws and the knuckles. Place the knuckle and claw into the head
                cavity. The preparation of the lobster can be done in advance and refrigerated until
                required
            </li>
            <li>
                Start the thermidor by heating a small amount of butter in a large saucepan. Sweat
                the onion and fennel on a ow to medium heat until oft with no colour. Add tomato
                puree and cook for a further 4-5 mintues
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, add the mustard and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring to incorporate all the
                other ingredients i the pan. Add the brandy and reduce by half. Pour in the wine and
                bring to boil
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, add lobster stock and bring to a simmer for 10-15 minutes until the liquid
                slightly thickens. Add the cream and allow to come to the boil while stirring in the
                grated cheese. Add 5 dashes of tabaso or more to taste, remove from heat, stir in
                tarragon and leave to cool
            </li>
            <li>
                For the final stages of the dish, place the prepared lobsters (in shell) in a
                shallow pan, meat side up. Add enough water to just cover the base of the pan and
                place over a ow to medium heat. As soon as the water to begins to steam, remove the
                pan from the heat and leave to stand for 4 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                Lift out lobster out of the pan and pour out any excess juice. Sprinkle over small
                amount of the grated cheese and heat the thermidor sauce, stirring constantly until
                boiling. Taste the sauce and season to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the lobster to a warm plate and pour over the hot thermidore sauce. Serve
                with chips and fresh fennel and chervil friands
            </li>
