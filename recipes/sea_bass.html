        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Alfred Prasad's flavourful sea bass recipe serves the pan-fried fish fillets with fine beans</p>
        <p>and raw mango. The sea bass is served with a sauce of fresh tomatoes with mustard, curry</p>
        <p>leaves and coconut. Densely-layered and impressive, this recipe takes a little care and</p>
        <p> attention to get right - but the end result is well worth the effort.</p>

        <h3>GARNISH</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lemon, cut into slices</li>
            <li>1 handful of fresh coriander</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, make the sauce. Put the ginger, shallots and tomatoes into a blender and blitz
                until smooth
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a pan. Add the mustard seeds and allow them to crackle before adding
                the fenugreek seeds, curry leaves, ginger and sliced shallot mix
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the onions. Stir occasionally and cook until the onions are golden-brown. Add
                turmeric powder and sauté for a couple of minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                Next add the tomato purée and water, followed by the chilli, cumin and coriander
                powders and boil over a high flame for 20-25 minutes by which time the volume of
                liquid would have reduced and oil begins to float on top of the mixture
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn down the heat, add the coconut milk, stir gently, bring to a boil, and remove the
                pan from the heat
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix together a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, cumin seeds, turmeric powder and a
                sprinkle of salt
            </li>
            <li>
                Scale the fish and cut the fillets in half. Dip the fillets in the marinade and grill
                skin side first on a medium-hot non-stick pan. (Hold the fillets down for 1/2 a minute
                or so to ensure that the entire skin surface makes contact with the pan)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the fillets are added to the pan, turn the heat down low and grill for approximately
                3 minutes, turn over and grill for a further minute
            </li>
            <li>
                Throw the beans and raw mango into the pan as soon as the fillets are turned over
            </li>
            <li>
                To plate, place 3 tbsp full of warm sauce in the centre of the plate, then top with the
                sautéed beans and raw mango
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the grilled fillets over the sauce and vegetables, and garnish with a slice of
                lemon and a sprig of fresh coriander
            </li>
        </ol>
